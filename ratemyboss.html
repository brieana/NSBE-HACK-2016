  <h1> Welcome to WaterCooler!</h1>

    <p style="font-size:20px"> Do you feel uncomfortable in your work environment? Are there things you wish you could tell your boss but are afraid to for fear of losing your job?"</p>
    <p style="font-size:16px"><strong> Then this is the right place for you!</strong> WaterCooler is an online resource that allows workers to anonomously give feedback<br> on their bosses or fill out evaluations and ensure that their job is protected</br></p>
    <p style="font-size:14px">Many workers have to wake up in the morning and go to a job that they hate because of a bad boss. They are not able to say anything however because they understand <br> that their job could easily be replaced and fear getting fired. Our goal is to encourage low-paid workers</br> to actively to improve their work environment by letting their boss know what they're doing wrong without risking unemployment</p>
