<template name="About">


<div style="margin-left: 220px">
  <h2 style="font-size:34px"> Welcome to WaterCooler!</h2>
      <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: left; font-family: Georgia"> Do you feel uncomfortable in your work environment? Are there things you wish you could tell your boss but are afraid to for fear of losing your job?<strong> Then this is the right place for you!</strong></p>
  <h3 style="font-size:24px"> What are we? </h3>
      <p style="font-size:20px; text-align:left; font-family: Georgia"> WaterCooler is a public, anonymous forum that gives workers the opportunity to safely provide feedback to bosses and

managers within a company. Many workers wake up in the morning and go to a job that they hate because of a bad boss. They are not able to speak their minds because they understand that their job could easily be replaced and fear getting fired.  </p>
    <h3 style="font-size:24px"> Our Goal </h3>
      <p style="font-size:20px">We hope to encourage low-paid workers to actively work to improve their work environment by letting their boss know what they're doing wrong (or right) without risking unemployment.</p>
    <h3 style="font-size:24px"> Here to help you! </h3>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align:left; font-family: Georgia">  WaterCooler was inspired by the need for workers to be able to unite and connect

based on their shared experiences.  We want to not only give workers a way to address the issues they face in

their workspace, but also provide them with resources to handle these issues. WaterCooler is great in that it can

speed up the realization of certain prevelant issues at work and provide real solutions to

these problems. This unique platform of communication also  allows

employees to create their own surveys that could potentially be made available to their coworkers in order to build a community with others that may be experiencing the same issues and ask more questions to see if a problem they are experiencing is more common amoung the community than they think</p></div>

<template name="Evaluations">
  <h2> Evaluation</h2>
  <p> This is a place where you can fill out an anonymous evaluation of your boss so make sure to be honest with your opinions. Contructive criticism is what will help your work environment better.  </p>

<template name="Feedback">
  <h2> Feedback (Comments and Criticisms)</h2>
      <p style="font-size:24px"> If you don't want to fill out an evalutation but still want to tell your boss how you've been feeling, send them some anonymous feeback here!</p>
    <ol>
      <h3> Sample comments</h3>
      <li> <strong> Anonymous:</strong> Dear Mark, When I suggest ideas at work I feel like you don't take me seriously and that makes me not want to speak up anymore</li>
      <li><strong> Anonymous: </strong> Dear Phil, Sometimes I feel like you play favorites and it makes me uncomfortable knowing that progress is the company could be determined by who you like the most rather than who does the best job </li>
