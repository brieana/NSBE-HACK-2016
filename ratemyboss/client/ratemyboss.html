<template name="About">


<h2 style="font-size:34px"> Welcome to WaterCooler!</h2>
  <div style="margin-left: 220px">  <p style="font-size:24px; text-align: left; font-family: Georgia"> Do you feel uncomfortable in your work environment? Are there things you wish you could tell your boss but are afraid to for fear of losing your job?</p>
    <p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left; font-family: Georgia"><strong> Then this is the right place for you!</strong> WaterCooler is an online resource that allows workers to anonymously give feedback on their bosses or fill out evaluations while ensuring that their job is protected.</p>
    <p style="font-size:24px; text-align:left; font-family: Georgia">Many workers have to wake up in the morning and go to a job that they hate because of a bad boss. They are not able to say anything however because they understand that their job could easily be replaced and fear getting fired. Our goal is to encourage low-paid workers to actively work to improve their work environment by letting their boss know what they're doing wrong without risking unemployment.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 24px; text-align:left; font-family: Georgia">The WaterCooler is a public, anonymous forum for safely giving feedback to bosses and

managers within a company.  By utilizing The WaterCooler, employees can be empowered by

having a say in how their managers are doing and voicing both opinions and revealing any illegal

infractions upon their rights.  As a platform for communication, The WaterCooler allows

employees to create their own surveys for their coworkers to take and establish that they are not

alone in their struggles.

The WaterCooler was inspired by the need for workers to be able to unite and connect

based on their shared experiences.  The goal is to not only identify the issues faced by workers in

their jobs, but to also give them options and resources to deal with issues.  The WaterCooler can

speed up the realization that issues are prevalent in a workplace and lead to real solutions to

these problems.</p></div>

      <li><strong> Anonymous: </strong> Dear Phil, Sometimes I feel like you play favorites and it makes me uncomfortable knowing that progress is the company could be determined by who you like the most rather than who does the best job </li>
