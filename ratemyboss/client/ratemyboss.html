  <div style="margin-left: 220px">
  <h2 style="font-size:34px"> Welcome to WaterCooler!</h2>
      <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: left; font-family: Georgia"> Do you feel uncomfortable in your work environment? Are there things you wish you could tell your boss but are afraid to for fear of losing your job?<strong> Then this is the right place for you!</strong></p>
  <h3 style="font-size:24px"> What are we? </h3>
      <p style="font-size:20px; text-align:left; font-family: Georgia"> WaterCooler is a public, anonymous forum that gives workers the opportunity to safely provide feedback to bosses and

managers within a company. Many workers wake up in the morning and go to a job that they hate because of a bad boss. They are not able to speak their minds because they understand that their job could easily be replaced and fear getting fired.  </p>
    <h3 style="font-size:24px"> Our Goal </h3>

      <p style="font-size:24px">We hope to encourage low-paid workers to actively work to improve their work environment by letting their boss know what they're doing wrong (or right) without risking unemployment.</p>

    <h3 style="font-size:24px"> Here to help you! </h3>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align:left; font-family: Georgia">  WaterCooler was inspired by the need for workers to be able to unite and connect

based on their shared experiences.  We want to not only give workers a way to address the issues they face in

their workspace, but also provide them with resources to handle these issues. WaterCooler is great in that it can

speed up the realization of certain prevelant issues at work and provide real solutions to

these problems. This unique platform of communication also  allows

employees to create their own surveys that could potentially be made available to their coworkers in order to build a community with others that may be experiencing the same issues and ask more questions to see if a problem they are experiencing is more common amoung the community than they think.</p>

    <h3 style="font-size:24px"> Disclosure </h3>
      <p style="font-size:20px; text-align:left; font-family: Georgia"> Anything submitted on the feedback section of The WaterCooler is open to view by the general public.

Information submitted in the evaluations section of the The WaterCooler is private and can only be seen within the company that has requested the evaluation.

Anonymity in The WaterCooler is to protect the workers, and prevent any retaliation that could come from public negative feedback.

The goal here is to allow those submitting feedback to be honest and open, which will facilitate the right improvements in their workplaces.</p>

<template name="Evaluations">
  <div style="margin-left: 220px">
  <h2> Evaluation</h2>
  <p style="font-size:20px"> This is a place where you can fill out an anonymous evaluation of your boss so make sure to be honest with your opinions. Contructive criticism is what will help your work environment better.  </p>

<template name="Feedback">
  <div style="margin-left: 220px">
  <h2 style="font-family: Georgia"> Feedback (Comments and Criticisms)</h2>
      <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Georgia"> If you don't want to fill out an evalutation but still want to tell your boss how you've been feeling, send them some anonymous feeback here!</p>

      <h3 style="font-size:30px; font-family: Georgia"> Sample comments</h3>
      <li style="font-size:24px; font-family: Georgia"> <strong> User 20189:</strong>The new policy that they implemented makes me feel like I have to compete with others in order to get my paycheck</li>
      <li style="font-size:24px; font-family: Georgia"><strong> User 30294: </strong> The fact that we get paid on Monday is so inconvenient. I wish we got paid on Friday so that we coud use the money over the weekend</li>
      <h3 style="font-size:30px; font-family: Georgia"> Sample Scenarios</h3>
      <li style="font-size:24px"> <strong> The Boss That Shows Favorites </strong> At Company A, the Big Boss is known for showing favorites.

This can be a natural progression to getting to know employees, and Big Boss doesnâ€™t even notice what they are doing.

When the boss requests an evaluation from WaterCooler to judge the working environment at their company,

the employees can safely tell Big Boss what is happening without fear of exposing themselves personally to the ire of the boss. </li>

    <li style="font-size:24px"> <strong> Widespread Health and Safety Issue </strong> Company C has introduced a new technology that saves money and is good for the environment.

This development was lauded as a great innovation and has gained the company much renown.

However, the use of this technology has proven to be unhealthy for the employees.  As the technology is so important to the company,

an employee could be reluctant to report this problem.  Without the knowledge that others are also suffering as they are, the employee could be seen as simply complaining.

By using the Feedback feature and creating their own survey for their company, an employee can gather their own data and see that there is a serious problem.

Then, with the resources provided by WaterCooler they can organize and unite to secure their rights and health. </li>
